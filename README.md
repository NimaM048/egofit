## Local Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file from your deployment values.
   - Start from `.env.example` and fill in the real values for your environment.
4. Use SQLite locally if needed:

```bash
set DJANGO_USE_SQLITE=true
```

5. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
